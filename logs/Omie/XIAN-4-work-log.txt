Issue Line Location: N/a

What needed to be fixed: The MVC layout needed to be created.

How it has been fixed: Unable to load an actual MVC framework due to the SOIS webspace failing server requirements, I've fashioned an MVC layout and created a database connection template to give the project some sort of foundation. 

What still needs to be fixed: Front-end libraries need to be added with npm.

How to test: You should see the following folders in place: 

model/data
controller/
view/css
view/js/jquery
pages/home

* If you do not see some of the View folders (view/js/jquery & view/css), then that means there are no files present in the system. There is not an error. As long as the model/ view/ and controller/ folders appear, the basic layout is created.
