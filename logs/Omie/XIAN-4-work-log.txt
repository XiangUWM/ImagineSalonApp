What needed to be fixed: The Slim Framework needed to be loaded to the server.

How it has been fixed: I required the Slim/SlimStarter framework package through Composer, and then I ran the autoloader to install the package. 

What still needs to be fixed: Nothing, the framework is fully installed. 

How to test: Go to the domain. A welcome page should appear.
