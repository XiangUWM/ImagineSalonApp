# ImagineSalonApp

## Benchmarking

In order for this project to be a success, we need to develop a consistency plan for performance. 

### Planning

#### The Agenda 

**Objective**: Build a scheduling and inventory management web application for Imagine Salon. At the moment, the current system is outdated, overly complicated, and unfortunately they're paying $75 monthly for it. It is our goal to create a user-friendly tabular interface to facilitate day-to-day business activities.
