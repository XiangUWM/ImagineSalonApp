# ImagineSalonApp

## Benchmarking

In order for this project to be a success, we need to develop a consistency plan for performance. 

### Planning

#### The Agenda 

Build a scheduling and inventory management web application for Imagine Salon. At the moment, the current system is outdated, overly complicated, and unfortunately they're paying $75 monthly for it. It is our goal to create a user-friendly tabular interface to facilitate day-to-day business activities. 

### Presentation 

We will need to: 

+ Create a scheduling service that keeps track of clients and staff. 
+ Create an inventory management system that keeps track of inventory.
+ Migrate the data for the staff and 250 customers to the proposed system to demonstrate functionality. 
+ Demonstrate usage with a series of tutorial videos.
